<p> With the migrant and housing crisis, many New Yorkers have been displaced and are eager to find housing that is accessible and affordable. Visitors of a local neighborhood food pantry just two blocks shy of Mott Haven Houses, a NYCHA development in the South Bronx, spoke to the NY News Service about the rates of affordable housing available. Esther Lam, a senior who's lived in public housing for the last 37 years, remembers waiting on a list for 6-7 years for her current NYCHA apartment in the South Bronx. Today, she knows a lot of people looking for affordable housing that she says, seems impossible to find. She says, “I know a lot of people in dire need of housing and I see a lot of vacancies in my complex and I don’t understand why.” 
Vacancies in NYCHA facilities aren’t uncommon. </p>

<p> NYCHA is the largest public housing authority in the nation, serving 525,686 residents with its  177,569 units. The state authority has dealt with lots of scrutiny over the years in regards to its infrastructure, poor living conditions and safety concerns addressed by its tenants as well as state regulators. 

Lisa Bovette Hiatt, who was appointed CEO of New York City Housing Authority by Mayor Eric Adams earlier this summer, sat down for an interview with New York 1 to address some of the vacancy rates. </p>

<p> Hiatt says, “when you look at our vacancy rate, which is lower than the city's vacancy rate. It’s lower than the average public housing authority vacancy rate. We’re making those apartments safer. We’re remediating them from lead, asbestos and mold, so that when someone moves into an apartment, they can move in and feel comfortable.”

But the demand for housing has made many New Yorkers uneasy with any unoccupied housing on the market. </p>

<p> Both Queens and Staten Island experienced the lowest amount of NYCHA developments available when compared to Brooklyn, Manhattan and Bronx due to a smaller population of developments. Overall NYCHA vacancies were at its lowest rate running under 500. While the chart does not represent the entire year, those numbers have since then jumped significantly, reaching nearly 3,500 vacancies to date. </p>
